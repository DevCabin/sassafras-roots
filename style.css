=================================================================================

Here's the stuff from http://roots.io/roots-101/ that you need after 
you "CD" into the theme directory via command line


    1. Install grunt-cli globally with npm install -g grunt-cli.
    
    2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run npm install. 
    
    
Please erase this bit from style.css after you're done with it.
